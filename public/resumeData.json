    "bio": "Hi there! My name is Nishil and I enjoy creating things. My interest in computers started back in late 2019 when I decided to take my first programming course - turns out I did not do well in that class. Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of working at a huge company, a joint venture of libraries and colleges, and a student-led research. My main focus these days is building digital experiences through web applications and machine learning models for the community. In my free time, I can be found trying different coffee shops, reading books, or taking nature walks.",

He has been instrumental in developing NLP modeling and visualization applications since he began with us a year ago.",
